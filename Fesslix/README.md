# Fesslix

Fesslix is a Free software program to perform stochastic analysis (e.g. reliability analysis and Bayesian updating). The source code is written in C++ and is available free of charge under the Free Software GPL license. Fesslix comes with a powerful and flexible input language that allows coupling of almost any model (external application) to Fesslix.

A brief summary of the main features of Fesslix:

- Perform non-intrusive reliability analysis or Bayesian updating either
    * by running commands on the command line or
    * by means of an Octave/Matlab interface or
    * by means of a Python interface
- Flexible input language for writing Fesslix parameter files
    * control flow statements (e.g. if, for, while)
    * Most parameters can be defined as functions
- Working with response surfaces
- Linear finite element analysis using truss, beam and plane stress/strain elements
- Spectral Stochastic Finite Elements
- Bayesian networks
